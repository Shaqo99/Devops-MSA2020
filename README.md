**Description:**

This is a simple build release pipeline that is very similar to the MSA2020 tutorial.
Building the pipeline, it was linked to my github account so that whenever I push a commit
to the master, the pipeline will run. The react web app uses the release pipeline to deploy 
the web app using the azure services.
